## 📌 Project Title

Greenfield High School Store Database Management System

## 📖 Description

This project is a MySQL-based relational database designed to manage a **school store** at Greenfield High School. It handles:

* Products and categories
* Suppliers and stock
* Customers and employees
* Orders, order items, and payments

The database enforces data integrity with **primary keys, foreign keys, constraints, and relationships** (1-1, 1-M, M-M).

## ⚙️ Setup / How to Run

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd greenfield-school-store
   ```
2. Open MySQL and run:

   ```bash
   mysql -u your_user -p < school_store_schema.sql
   ```
3. (Optional) Insert sample data by uncommenting the lines at the bottom of the SQL file.

## 🗂️ Deliverables

* **school\_store\_schema.sql** → Main schema file (tables, constraints, relationships).
* **README.md** → Documentation and setup guide.
* **ERD Screenshot** → Visual representation of the schema.
